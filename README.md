# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview

The overview of this analysis was to use multiple machine learning models to train and evaluate models related to our Credit Risk Analysis. We did this by using the "imbalanced-learn" and "scikit-learn" libraries to build and evaluate our models using resampling.  We used "RandomOverSampler" and "SMOTE" to oversample our data and used the "ClusterCentroids" algorithm to undersample the data. After that we used the "SMOTEENN" algorithm to use a combination of approaches through over- and undersampling the data. Finally, we will compare two more models aimed at reducing bias, "BalancedRandomForestClassifier" and "EasyEnsembleClassifier" to try and predict credit risk for our analysis. Once we have run our different models, we will be able to make a recommendation on whether or not this is a reliable approach to predict credit risk.

## Results
: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

## Summary
Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
